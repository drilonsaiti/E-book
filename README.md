# E-book - Book search app

This application is a semantic web technology. Through technologies like Java Spring Boot and Jena, we retrieve data from Dbpedia and present it in our application, using RDFa to represent it in a structured manner. The application contains over 7,000 listed books, data for each book and author. The application has three pages, the main page displaying all the books, and a page with detailed information about the book and author.

All information is retrieved using SPARQL and Jena, meaning a Jena SPARQL query is set to an endpoint at dbpedia.org/sparql.
